# TF-Wine-Quality-Dataset
This is my take on the Wine Quality Dataset.  
The wine quality has two available dataset, one for white wine and one for the red wine.
Each dataset can be used to predict the quality of the wine based on the wine features.  
In this take, I combined the two dataset and added another column that indicates if it is a red wine or white wine.  
I created a model that will take the wine features and release two outputs, the wine quality and the wine type.  
I used tensorflow functional API in creating the model itself.
